In addition to migrating data directly from a :ref:`supported database
<supported-databases>`, Relational Migrator supports snapshot data migration
from other databases through a JDBC connection. 

.. note::

   You can't create a continuous migration job from a JDBC connection.

About this Task
---------------

- JDBC connections are loaded from the :ref:`user.properties file
  <file-location>`. 


Before You Begin
----------------

- :ref:`Save a JDBC Connection <rm-save-jdbc-connection>` in your
  user.properties file.

- :ref:`Create one or more mapping rules <create-rule-relational>` in your 
  Relational Migrator project.


Steps
-----

.. procedure::

  .. step:: Create a JDBC Connection

  .. step:: Create a new snapshot migration job
