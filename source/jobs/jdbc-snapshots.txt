In addition to migrating data directly from a :ref:`supported database
<supported-databases>`, Relational Migrator supports snapshot data migration
from other databases through a JDBC connection. 

.. note::

   You can't create a continuous migration job from a JDBC connection.

About this Task
---------------

- Instead of using a saved :ref:`Relational Database Connection
  <rm-save-relational-connection>`, JDBC connections are loaded from

.. <a file> ..


Before You Begin
----------------

- :ref:`Create one or more mapping rules <create-rule-relational>` in your 
  Relational Migrator project.

Steps

  .. step:: Create a JDBC Connection
