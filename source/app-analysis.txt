After connecting to a relational database, you can run pre-migration analysis
to identify potential configuration issues prior to attempting data migration.
The resulting report summarizes necessary actions to take before migrating your data.

.. important::

   Relational Migrator supports Pre-Migration Analysis for Microsoft SQL
   Server, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. Pre-Migration Analysis isn't
   supported for databases connected through a JDBC driver. For more
   information on supported databases and versions, see
   :ref:`supported-databases`.
