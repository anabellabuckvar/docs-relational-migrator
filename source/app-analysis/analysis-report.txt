To see all potential migration risks that Relational Migrator checks for, see
the :ref:`Migration Risk Reference <rm-risk-reference>`.

Summary
--------

The Summary section lists the overall migration readiness of your database, and
provides a breakdown of the metrics that inform that readiness level.

The Detection Breakdown shows how many detections have Actions Required,
are Potential Risks, or are strictly Informational.

The Database Object Overview shows detections for Tables, Stored Procedures,
Triggers, and Views. Table risks are further categorized as Data Type, Schema,
Unsupported Feature, or Performance.

Once you've addressed the migration risks, you can run Pre-Migration Analysis
again by clicking :guilabel:`Rerun analysis`, to confirm that there aren't any
more issues.
